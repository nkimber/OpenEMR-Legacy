# Modernized OpenEMR Implementation Plan

Created: 2026-06-18

## Purpose

This document defines how the project will rebuild OpenEMR from scratch on the modernized stack while preserving the observable workflow behavior and user-facing familiarity of the legacy OpenEMR baseline.

The target is not a cosmetic clone of old PHP pages. The target is a modern application that existing OpenEMR users can migrate to with minimal workflow shock because navigation, terminology, screen intent, and task outcomes remain recognizable.

## North Star

Rebuild OpenEMR as a modern system with:

- React SPA frontend.
- ASP.NET Core / C# backend API and business tier.
- PostgreSQL database.
- Docker Compose local runtime.
- Shared synthetic gold dataset seeded into both legacy and modernized databases.
- Parity tests that run against both systems.
- Modernization Workbench orchestration, evidence, and comparison.

## Fidelity Rules

The modernized UI should remain faithful where user muscle memory matters:

- Preserve the major OpenEMR module structure and workflow names.
- Preserve patient search, chart, encounter, scheduling, billing, lab, medication, message, and administration task flow.
- Preserve key field names and visible domain concepts unless a documented decision renames them.
- Preserve outcomes and validation behavior before changing interaction patterns.
- Prefer clearer layout, accessibility, responsiveness, and performance while avoiding gratuitous workflow redesign.

The implementation should not preserve legacy technical constraints:

- Do not preserve PHP frames as an architecture pattern.
- Do not keep business rules in UI components.
- Do not encode business logic in database-specific scripts or stored procedures.
- Do not require MariaDB table shapes in the modern API.
- Do not make the React UI call the database directly.

## Target Architecture

### Frontend

- React with TypeScript.
- SPA-like client-side application.
- Route-based modules that mirror OpenEMR user tasks.
- API client layer that calls the modernized backend.
- UI components organized by workflow slice.
- Styling that is familiar to legacy OpenEMR users but cleaner, responsive, and accessible.

### Backend

- ASP.NET Core 10 Web API.
- Minimal APIs grouped by feature for early slices; keep handlers thin.
- Business rules in application services.
- Request/response DTOs separate from database entities.
- Health endpoint for Workbench/runtime checks.
- OpenAPI enabled for discoverable contracts.

### Database

- PostgreSQL.
- Modernized schema designed around domain concepts rather than direct MariaDB table mimicry.
- Migrations or schema scripts owned by the modernized solution.
- Seed adapter that consumes the shared canonical gold dataset.
- Database-specific behavior kept behind backend services.

### Workbench Integration

- Modernized OpenEMR becomes a managed application in `modernization-workbench/config/apps.json`.
- Workbench can start, stop, restart, health-check, seed, and run tests for the modernized target.
- Workbench comparison views should eventually show legacy-vs-modernized parity status by workflow.

## Vertical Slice Strategy

Each slice follows the same loop:

1. Discover legacy behavior and identify seed-data anchors.
2. Ensure or add legacy parity tests for the workflow.
3. Add or extend PostgreSQL seed mapping from the canonical dataset.
4. Implement modern database schema, backend API, and frontend UI.
5. Add modernized target adapters to the parity harness where needed.
6. Run the same tests against legacy and modernized targets.
7. Compare results and document accepted differences.
8. Update Workbench progress and project docs.

## Slice Order

### Slice 1: Patient Search And Chart Summary

Goal:

- Implement the first read-only workflow that existing users immediately recognize.

Status:

- Implemented as the first modernized target slice under `modernized-openemr/`.
- Verified with local builds, Docker Compose runtime, PostgreSQL gold-data seed, modernized smoke checks, and matched side-by-side slice-1 parity runs against the legacy baseline.

Scope:

- PostgreSQL patient seed table from the canonical gold dataset.
- API endpoints for patient search/list and patient chart summary.
- React patient finder and chart summary UI.
- Workbench-managed modernized runtime and seed action.
- Parity target activation for read-only database/API/UI checks where practical.

Acceptance:

- Modernized app can start locally and through Docker Compose.
- Modernized database can be seeded from the shared gold dataset.
- Patient search returns Avery Stone / `MOD-PAT-0001` and other canonical patients.
- Patient chart summary displays demographics, contact information, care-team metadata, activity counts, next appointment, and latest encounter faithful to legacy OpenEMR screen intent.
- Workbench can see the modernized target as a running managed application.

Current limitations:

- This slice is read-only.
- Modernized authentication is deferred to the administration/security slice.
- Reusable parity-test adapters now exist for the first read-only slice: PostgreSQL database probes, shared anchor-patient checks, and Playwright chart visibility checks.
- Mutation-capable workflow parity remains deferred until CRUD slices are implemented.

### Slice 2: Scheduling

Goal:

- Implement the first scheduling workflow that lets existing users find and inspect future appointments from the modernized Calendar module.

Status:

- Implemented as a read-only scheduling slice under `modernized-openemr/`.
- Verified with local builds, Docker Compose runtime, modernized smoke checks, and matched side-by-side slice-2 scheduling parity runs against the legacy baseline.

Scope:

- PostgreSQL appointment queries from the canonical gold dataset.
- API endpoints for future appointment list/search and appointment detail.
- React Calendar module with appointment filter, appointment list, and appointment detail panels.
- Workbench-managed slice-2 scheduling parity plan for both legacy and modernized targets.
- Scheduling parity tests using existing gold scheduling anchors.

Acceptance:

- Calendar module is selectable from the modernized left navigation.
- Future appointments can be filtered by canonical patient ID, public patient ID, or legacy PID.
- Appointment detail displays patient, date, time, duration, status, room, provider, facility, category, and appointment ID.
- The `slice-2-scheduling-readiness` plan passes against both legacy and modernized targets with no comparison differences.

Current limitations:

- This slice is read-only.
- Appointment create, cancel, update, and delete workflows remain deferred to a later scheduling mutation slice.

### Slice 3: Encounters And Clinical Notes

Scope:

- Encounter list and encounter summary.
- Vitals and SOAP details.
- Encounter create/update/delete workflows.

### Slice 4: Clinical Lists And Medications

Scope:

- Problems, allergies, medication list, prescriptions.
- Create/deactivate/delete workflows.
- Medication reconciliation user flow.

### Slice 5: Messaging And Portal-Facing Data

Scope:

- Patient messages and status lifecycle.
- Portal-enabled patient flags.
- Message workflow parity tests.

### Slice 6: Labs And Procedure Results

Scope:

- Procedure orders, reports, and results.
- Lab review UI and result details.
- Lab lifecycle parity tests.

### Slice 7: Billing And Fee Sheet

Scope:

- Encounter billing lines.
- CPT entry and bill status lifecycle.
- Insurance-aware billing summaries.

### Slice 8: Administration, Security, And Audit

Scope:

- Users, roles, permissions, facilities.
- Authentication and authorization.
- Audit logging and security-sensitive behavior.

### Slice 9: Reports, Documents, And Integrations

Scope:

- Reports and exports.
- Documents.
- External integration surfaces that matter for the modernization demo.

## Test Strategy

Modernization testing uses the existing layers:

- Native legacy tests remain implementation confidence for the baseline.
- Shared parity tests define cross-system behavior.
- Database probes normalize domain facts for MariaDB and PostgreSQL.
- HTTP/API tests validate backend-visible behavior.
- Playwright UI tests validate user-facing workflows.
- Workflow mutation tests validate CRUD lifecycle behavior.
- Comparison artifacts prove side-by-side parity.

For modernized work, a slice is not done until the relevant parity tests can run against both targets or a documented gap explains why the slice is not yet comparable.

## Data Migration Strategy

The first implementation uses the canonical gold dataset rather than a live legacy dump. This keeps the modernization test loop deterministic and non-PHI.

For each slice:

- Define modern PostgreSQL tables for the slice.
- Map canonical dataset records into the modern schema.
- Keep source dataset IDs such as `canonicalId`, `pid`, and `pubpid` available for parity lookup.
- Avoid coupling modern business logic to legacy MariaDB column names.
- Document any semantic mapping decision that is not obvious.

## UI Fidelity Strategy

The modern UI should look and feel like a cleaner OpenEMR application:

- Operational app shell, not a marketing page.
- Familiar patient finder and chart workspace.
- Dense, scannable clinical information.
- Clear module navigation.
- No decorative hero layouts.
- Use modern spacing, responsive behavior, and accessible controls.
- Keep labels and screen vocabulary close to legacy OpenEMR.

## Definition Of Done For A Slice

A slice is complete when:

- Modernized schema/API/UI are implemented.
- Seed adapter loads the required canonical data into PostgreSQL.
- Unit or service tests exist where business logic is non-trivial.
- HTTP/API checks pass.
- Playwright UI checks pass for user-facing behavior.
- Parity evidence is generated and, when both targets are implemented, compared.
- Workbench reflects runtime, seed, and test status.
- Documents and changelog are updated.
